Codebook: There didn’t seem to be one! Here’s what I think:

- Usuable information:
  - block_number: Dummy variable, always 1.
  - _block_name_: colour of word presented on this trial, followed by non-informative stuff.
  - _block_pairing_definition_: the correct response for this trial.
  - _study_name_: cebersole.XXX, where XXX is the location this participant was tested.
  - 
 
- Other columns
   
  - block_trial_count: 12 = practice block, 21 = main block
